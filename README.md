# Analysing Malicous PDFs üìÅ

PDFs are sometimes tricky to analyse. Malware Author can use this for Phishing, Implement Droppers & Downloaders.

Like in this Sample (MD5: eecde7b70136e606adcd3e56452aca2a)

It has almost no detectiopn in VT, Got undetected by many AVs.

As well as in Sandboxes

But this sample is malicious, that we'll see later. First we'll learn about some basics of PDFs.

# PDF File Format üíå

1. PDF header: Contains info about the version of the PDF such as %PDF-1.6

2. Body:

Streams: a sequence of bytes such as images or data, which comes in encoded data.

Objects: How to render documanets which can include text or javascript.

Others such as names, dictionaries, strings, and arrays.

Dictionary entry is an item between ¬´ ¬ª and starts with slash / such as /Root which is the first object will be processed after loading the PDF file, /Root could be found in the Trailer section.

3. Cross-reference table: contains the offsets of file‚Äôs objects.

4. Trailer: contains the offset of xref table, and number of objects, /Root.

üëâ Some usefull keywords after parsing:

/Js, /JavaScript: To execute embedded javascript

/Launch, /EmbeddedFiles: To launch exeternal or embedded files

/URI: To interact with URLs

/OpenAction, /AA: To open an action

/FlateDecode: uses the zlib/deflate decompression method.

A comment in PDF starts with %

And Use pdfid.py, peepdf.py and pdf-parser.py to extract strings, URLs, Embedded Files, Flate decode and content of objects of PDFs

After parsing we can see the PDF has a URL which is malicious

And when you open the malicious PDF, it will redirect you to above malicious URL and here we can see the malicious network activity too.
